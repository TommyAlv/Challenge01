# Challenge 1
## Acceptance Criteria
- When a user views the website, it is built in a way that caters to users using accessibility software.
  - Codebase contains html semantic elements like “Section”, “Nav”, etc. 
  - Codebase is structured in a way that would be concise for an accessibility software user to read.

## Description
For this challenge, I went through and modified the assorted “div”s to more follow accessibility semantics. Specifically identifying the header, article, footer, and nav. I also added alt information for each of the images and icons available in the html. Finally, I confirmed that there were no larger than a single transition from heading sizes in the code.
